## System Overview

This LSM-Tree Key/Value storage system is designed to meet the requirements of a persistent, network-available storage engine with high performance characteristics. The system implements a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) architecture, which is widely used in modern database systems like LevelDB, RocksDB, and Cassandra.

### Core Requirements Addressed

1. **Low latency per item read/write**: Achieved through in-memory memtable and bloom filters
2. **High throughput for random writes**: LSM-Tree's sequential write pattern optimizes for write performance
3. **Handle datasets larger than RAM**: Multi-level storage with compaction manages memory efficiently
4. **Crash friendliness**: Write-ahead logging ensures data durability and fast recovery
5. **Predictable behavior under load**: Background compaction prevents performance degradation

### Component Responsibilities

- **HTTP API Server**: Handles client requests, validates input, manages connections
- **LSM Engine**: Orchestrates all storage operations, manages memtable flushes
- **MemTable**: Fast in-memory storage for recent writes
- **WAL**: Ensures durability by logging all writes before applying to memtable
- **SSTables**: Persistent storage with sorted data and bloom filters
- **Compaction Manager**: Background process that merges and optimizes SSTables

## Storage Engine Deep Dive

### LSM-Tree Structure

The LSM-Tree is organized in multiple levels, each with different characteristics:

```
Level 0: [SSTable1] [SSTable2] [SSTable3] [SSTable4] (4 SSTables max, unsorted)
Level 1: [Merged SSTable] (10x larger than Level 0, sorted)
Level 2: [Merged SSTable] (10x larger than Level 1, sorted)
...
Level 6: [Merged SSTable] (10x larger than Level 5, sorted)
```

### MemTable Implementation

**Data Structure**: Skip List
- **Why Skip List?**: Provides O(log n) operations with simpler implementation than balanced trees
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only stores forward pointers, no parent pointers
- **Concurrency**: Easier to implement lock-free reads compared to B-trees

**Key Operations**:
```python
def put(key, value):
    # O(log n) insertion with automatic sorting
    skip_list.insert(key, value)

def get(key):
    # O(log n) lookup
    return skip_list.find(key)

def range_scan(start_key, end_key):
    # O(log n + k) where k is number of results
    return skip_list.range(start_key, end_key)
```

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

**Purpose**: Ensure durability and crash recovery
**Format**: Append-only log with checksums

```
WAL Entry Format:
[checksum:4][entry_length:4][operation:var][key_len:var][key:bytes][value_len:var][value:bytes][timestamp:8]
```

**Recovery Process**:
1. On startup, scan WAL file
2. Replay all operations in order
3. Rebuild memtable state
4. Clear WAL after successful recovery

### SSTable Format

**File Structure**:
```
┌─────────────┐
│ Data Blocks │ ← Sorted key-value pairs with varint encoding
├─────────────┤
│ Index Block │ ← Sparse index (every 16th key)
├─────────────┤
│Bloom Filter │ ← Probabilistic membership test
├─────────────┤
│  Metadata   │ ← Key count, offsets, timestamps
├─────────────┤
│   Footer    │ ← Checksums and bounds
└─────────────┘
```

**Key-Value Encoding**:
```
[key_len:varint][key:bytes][value_len:varint][value:bytes]
```

**Why Varint Encoding?**:
- Space efficient for small keys/values
- Self-delimiting (no need for length prefixes)
- Compatible with protobuf-style encoding

### Bloom Filter Implementation

**Purpose**: Fast negative lookups to avoid unnecessary disk reads
**Configuration**: 1% false positive rate, automatically sized based on expected items

```python
def contains(key):
    # Check if key MIGHT be in SSTable
    # Returns False if definitely not present
    # Returns True if might be present (could be false positive)
    for i in range(num_hash_functions):
        if not bit_array[hash(key, i)]:
            return False
    return True
```

**Trade-off**: Small memory overhead for significant read performance improvement

## Design Choices & Trade-offs

### 1. LSM-Tree vs B-Tree

**Chosen**: LSM-Tree
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **Write Performance**: Sequential writes to WAL + memtable
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Can handle datasets larger than RAM
- ✅ **Crash Recovery**: Natural durability through WAL
- ❌ **Read Amplification**: May need to check multiple levels
- ❌ **Write Amplification**: Compaction rewrites data multiple times

### 2. Skip List vs B-Tree for MemTable

**Chosen**: Skip List
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and debug
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: No parent pointers needed
- ✅ **Concurrency**: Simpler lock-free read implementation
- ❌ **Cache Performance**: Less cache-friendly than B-trees
- ❌ **Memory Overhead**: Multiple forward pointers per node

### 3. HTTP/REST vs Custom Binary Protocol

**Chosen**: HTTP/REST
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Easy to test with curl/Postman
- ✅ **Standardization**: Wide client support
- ✅ **Debugging**: Human-readable requests/responses
- ❌ **Performance**: Higher overhead than binary protocols
- ❌ **Latency**: HTTP parsing adds latency

### 4. Size-Tiered vs Leveled Compaction

**Chosen**: Size-Tiered
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **Write Performance**: Less write amplification
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and tune
- ✅ **Memory Usage**: Lower memory requirements
- ❌ **Read Performance**: More SSTables to check per read
- ❌ **Space Amplification**: Higher space overhead

### 5. In-Memory vs On-Disk Bloom Filters

**Chosen**: On-Disk (loaded on demand)
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Only load when needed
- ✅ **Scalability**: Can handle many SSTables
- ❌ **Latency**: Loading bloom filter adds I/O
- ❌ **Complexity**: Need to manage bloom filter lifecycle

## Internal Data Flow

### Write Operation Flow

```
1. Client Request (PUT /kv/key)
   ↓
2. HTTP Server validates request
   ↓
3. LSM Engine.put(key, value)
   ↓
4. Write to WAL (with fsync for durability)
   ↓
5. Write to MemTable (in-memory)
   ↓
6. Check if MemTable needs flushing
   ↓
7. If flush needed: MemTable → SSTable (Level 0)
   ↓
8. Clear WAL and MemTable
   ↓
9. Return success to client
```

### Read Operation Flow

```
1. Client Request (GET /kv/key)
   ↓
2. HTTP Server validates request
   ↓
3. LSM Engine.get(key)
   ↓
4. Check MemTable first (fastest)
   ↓
5. If not found, check SSTables (Level 0 → Level 6)
   ↓
6. For each SSTable:
   a. Check Bloom Filter (fast negative lookup)
   b. If bloom filter says "might exist":
      - Use sparse index to find approximate location
      - Binary search within data block
      - Return value if found
   ↓
7. Return result to client
```

### Compaction Flow

```
1. Background thread monitors SSTable counts
   ↓
2. When Level 0 has > 4 SSTables:
   ↓
3. Select all Level 0 SSTables for compaction
   ↓
4. Merge SSTables while removing duplicates (newest wins)
   ↓
5. Write merged SSTable to Level 1
   ↓
6. Delete old SSTables
   ↓
7. Update metadata and continue monitoring
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage

**MemTable**: Configurable (default 5MB)
**Bloom Filters**: ~1-2MB per SSTable
**Indexes**: ~1KB per 16 keys
**Total**: Scales with data size, but bounded by configuration

## Crash Recovery & Durability

### Durability Guarantees

**Write Durability**: 
- All writes are logged to WAL before applying to memtable
- WAL is fsync'd to disk for each write
- Guarantees: No data loss on crash

**Recovery Process**:
1. Scan WAL file on startup
2. Replay all operations in order
3. Rebuild memtable state
4. Clear WAL after successful recovery
5. Continue normal operation

**Recovery Time**: O(n) where n is number of WAL entries
- Typical: < 5 seconds for 1GB WAL
- Scales linearly with write volume

### Consistency Model

**Write Consistency**: Strong consistency within single node
- All writes are immediately visible after successful response
- No read-your-writes violations

**Read Consistency**: Strong consistency
- Reads always see latest committed writes
- No stale reads due to proper locking

## Implementation Details

### Threading Model

**Main Thread**: HTTP request handling
**Compaction Thread**: Background SSTable merging
**Locking Strategy**:
- MemTable: Reader-writer locks for concurrent reads
- WAL: Mutex for write operations
- SSTables: Immutable after creation (lock-free reads)

### Error Handling

**WAL Corruption**: Skip corrupted entries, continue recovery
**SSTable Corruption**: Skip corrupted SSTables, log error
**Disk Full**: Graceful degradation, return appropriate errors
**Memory Pressure**: Trigger memtable flushes more aggressively

### Configuration Tuning

**Key Parameters**:
```python
MEMTABLE_MAX_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
MEMTABLE_MAX_ENTRIES = 100000
MAX_LEVELS = 7
LEVEL_SIZE_MULTIPLIER = 10
WAL_SYNC_ON_WRITE = True
SSTABLE_BLOCK_SIZE = 64 * 1024  # 64KB
SSTABLE_INDEX_INTERVAL = 16
SSTABLE_BLOOM_FILTER_FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE = 0.01  # 1%
```

**Tuning Guidelines**:
- Larger memtable → Better write performance, more memory usage
- More levels → Better space efficiency, worse read performance
- WAL sync → Better durability, worse write performance
- Smaller block size → Better cache locality, more index overhead
- More frequent indexing → Faster reads, more storage overhead
- Lower false positive rate → More memory usage, fewer unnecessary disk reads

### Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics Exposed**:
- Operation counts (puts, gets, deletes, range scans)
- Memtable size and memory usage
- SSTable counts per level
- Compaction statistics (completed, merged SSTables, bytes compacted)
- WAL size and recovery time
- Bloom filter false positive rates
- Index efficiency metrics

**Health Checks**:
- `/health` endpoint for service availability
- `/stats` endpoint for detailed metrics
- Automatic error logging and recovery
